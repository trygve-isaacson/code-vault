vconfigure.h for Code Vault

This file is where you can define the switches that control which features are enabled
or disabled in the Vault library.
You should have a separate copy of this header file for each application, since each
application may have different requirements.
I recommend that you simply comment or un-comment the values below, so that it is
clear by reading which ones you are not using.
